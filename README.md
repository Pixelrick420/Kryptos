# Kryptos

**Kryptos** is a cryptography-based challenge game where participants solve a series of puzzles, including those based on cryptography, logic gates, coding, and data structures/algorithms (DSA). Players must figure out codes, unlock secrets, and progress through levels with each correct answer.

This game was made for a technical competition as part of Insignia '24, an event hosted by Computer Science department of GEC Thrissur.

The game is designed to be played within a time limit, encouraging problem-solving and cryptographic analysis. Players are recommended **not to cheat** by looking up answers online and rely on their skills instead.
